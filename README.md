I wanted a way to show my kids the power of generative AI, and thought that using it to write them quick short stories. As we GPT-4 releases, we'll be able to make longer ones. 

This builds off of the example content that I stashed away previously here - [OpenAI and NextJS]()

## Acknowledgements 

Huge thanks to the work Hassan El Mghari (https://twitter.com/nutlope) has done in the JavaScript/NextJS community with OpenAI. I wouldn't have been able to figure out the streaming part without his work (and largely borrowed code from his [TwitterBio](https://www.twitterbio.com/) site to accomplish it)
